1. **Interaction Designers :** see if a product fulfills the desires of both users and businesses while still being feasible. Understand the user flow.

2. **Visual Designers :** logos, illustrations, icons, product layouts.

3. **Motion Designers :** see what it feels like for a user to move through the product.


4. **Graphic Designers :** create visuals that convey a message [Graphic Designers focus on the appearance of a product wheread UX Designers focus on how users interact with a product.]

5. **Virtual Reality (VR) Designers** create products that provide users with immersive experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. On the other hand, **Augmented Reality (AR) Designers** use the physical world as a backdrop and add virtual elements on top of it.

### Product Development Lifecycle (five stages)

1. **Brainstorm** : generating ideas about the needs and challenges of the audience. Involves research and UX writing. Pay attention to diversity.
2. **Define** : use the insights from the brainstorm stage to outline the goals and problems faced. Who is the product for? What will the product do? And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful? 
3. **Design** : generate storyboards, wireframes, prototypes.
4. **Test** : evaluate the product design based on feedback from the user. Interact with front-end engineers. At this stage, the designs go through at least three phases of testing: internal tests within your company, reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users.
5. **Launch** : putting your product out there in the real world. Start promoting the product. Customer support team. Reflect. Were goals achieved? Were timelines met?
